# Bank

A simple JavaScript bank model. The crux of the challenge was in implementing meaningful tests in a context that did not involve revealing internal state, ie. the bank balance. After much thought I decided that while it was not the most perfect test of functionality, I would begin with a test for the ability to print a statement, and base subsequent tests on expectations of what should appear on the statement after calling the deposit or withdraw functions.

#### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
* Acceptance criteria

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012 And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 When she prints her bank statement Then she would see
```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
